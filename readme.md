## The Idea
---
We wanted to implement a system where people could have access to effective, yet discrete mental health support. In a nutshell, we wanted to build a safe space.

## The present situation...
---
We've spent a long time ignoring a multitude of facets of life under the tag of "man up" or dont be a baby, or to quote David rose from Schitt's Creek,

This needs to change.  It's gonna happen only if we start talking about it OPENLY. Remove the stigma around it.

## How did we get here?
---
So we got a chance to take part in a [state wide hackathon](https://reboot.asapkerala.gov.in) and we picked the healthcare track. We wanted to build something that (duh, would win, but also) once deployed, could help make atleast a minor difference in a few people's lives. 

> As they say, Baby steps. Baby steps first.

We were given exposure to professionals in the field of mental health.
