## The Idea
We wanted to implement a system where people could have access to effective, yet discrete mental health support. In a nutshell, we wanted to build a safe space.

### The present situation...
---
We've spent a long time ignoring a multitude of facets of life under the tag of "man up" or dont be a baby, or to quote David rose from Schitt's Creek,

This needs to change.  It's gonna happen only if we start talking about it OPENLY. Remove the stigma around it.

### How did we get here?
---
So we got a chance to take part in a [state wide hackathon](https://reboot.asapkerala.gov.in) and we picked the healthcare track. We wanted to build something that (duh, would win, but also) once deployed, could help make atleast a minor difference in a few people's lives. 

> As they say, Baby steps. Baby steps first.

We chose the following problem statement 
>

We were given exposure to professionals in the field of mental health. 


### What is mentem?
---
Mentem was originally intended to be an all in one platform for health clinics to provide assistance,and for people like you and me to seek medical support.
